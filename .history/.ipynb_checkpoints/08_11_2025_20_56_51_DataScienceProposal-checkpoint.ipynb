    "Understanding the demographics of video game players is important for improving user experience and allows developers to allocate server resources effectively. The first loaded dataset, players.csv, was collected from players on a public Minecraft server that described user details and profile information. It consists of 196 rows, each representing a unique player identification through hashed emails. The dataset includes information on users' demographics, experiences, and time spent on gaming, where each of the 7 columns represents a variable. <p></p>\n",

However, the columns start_time and end_time contains both the date and the time, making it difficult to analyze. Unlike the first data set, the same hashed Emails are listed multiple times as each player can have multiple recorded sessions. The original start/end times also show redundancy with session start/end time and it is not stored in a human-readable format. <p></p>\n",

    "To answer this question, we can first tidy the two dataframes by cleaning up column names, convert columns to appropriate data types (response variable for KNN classification must be a factor data type), and filter for desired predictors. We filter out played hours less than 0 since it is not meaningful for our analysis. Then, we can group multiple of the same hashed_email together from the sessions.csv dataframe to ensure data for each player is treated as one, and summarize by the total sessions (the number of times the same hashed email appears) to create the predicting variable. Next, we join the two dataframes into one in order to simplify the process of classification. "
