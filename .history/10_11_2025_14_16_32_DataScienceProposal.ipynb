    "Understanding the demographics of video game players is important for improving user experience and allows developers to allocate server resources effectively. The first loaded dataset, players.csv, was collected from players on a public Minecraft server that described user details and profile information. It consists of 196 rows, each representing a unique player identification through hashed emails. The dataset includes information on users' demographics, experiences, and time spent on gaming, where each of the 7 columns represents a variable. <p></p>\n",

This dataset contains 1535 rows, each regarding specific session start/end times and their respective dates. However, the columns start_time and end_time contains both the date and the time, making it difficult to analyze. Unlike the first data set, the same hashed Emails are listed multiple times as each player can have multiple recorded sessions. The original start/end times also show redundancy with session start/end time and it is not stored in a human-readable format. <p></p>\n",

We filter out played hours less than 0 since it is not meaningful for our analysis. Next, we group by both experience and age, and aggregate played hours to better see their relationship for each skill level. This can subsequently help us assess whether these variables are useful for predictive analysis."
